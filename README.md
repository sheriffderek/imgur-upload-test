# imgur-upload-test

Just trying to upload an image somewhere... so that I can send the URL to a printer... (but I don't want to setup a server)

The project this is for primarily - is a Shopify store. It uses jQuery / so, I was using that style of ajax... but no jQuery would be nicer... - / because we're using Vue for some UI sugar / and that drastically simplifies things.
